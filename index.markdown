Welcome to my personal website. Here are a few projects I have worked on:

## Projects


[Chemotherapy Manager](https://github.com/csalg/chemotherapy_manager) An app to manage chemotherapy doses. Currently in use at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital.


[SJTU Content-Based Publish_Subscribe Systems Performance Evaluator](https://github.com/csalg/pubsub) A framework to test different content-based publish-subscribe broker algorithms. Implements H-Tree, opIndex, REIN, Siena and TAMA.


## Classwork

- [Algorithms Design and Analysis: Final Project](https://github.com/csalg/algorithms_design_analysis_final_project) Implements and evaluates several algorithms for the Generalized Travelling Salesman and Capacitated Vehicle Routing problems
- [Bioinformatics Final Project](https://github.com/csalg/bioinformatics_final_project) A cool project exploring some of the recent sparse PLS algorithms with a genomics dataset.
- [Statistical Learning Final Project](https://github.com/csalg/statistical_learning_final_project) I applied semi-supervised learning, a novel technique that leverages unlabeled data, to earn one of the top scores in the class competition.


## FOSS Contributions

- Dockerfile for the [recent fork of LWT](https://github.com/PirtleShell/lwt), as well as [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/csalg/lwt_fork)
