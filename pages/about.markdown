# About 

I'm a Spanish software developer, currently pursuing a MSc in Computer Science in SJTU. 

I started using Linux around 2005, when I was in high school. I ran SuSE as well as an OS called BeOS. After a period of Apple unfaithfulness, I am back to being a free Linux user (I run Arch as my main driver). I also run a homelab and a Kimsufi VPS with all sorts of wonderful self-hosted apps such as LWT, Gitea, Dokuwiki, Nextcloud, Syncthing, V2Ray, and many more. 

This blog is mostly a collection of cool little geek recipes for personal use and for the world.
