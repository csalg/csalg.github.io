# About 

I'm a Spanish software developer, currently pursuing a MSc in Computer Science in SJTU. 

I'm into FOSS, the fediverse and distributed systems.

This blog is mostly a collection of cool little geek recipes born out of time spent in my homelab and on all sorts of systems.

I'm also rather fond of learning languages, fine literature and spending time with friends and family.
